## Assignment Proposal: Blog Management Application

### Introduction

In this assignment, I propose to create a web application for managing blog posts using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**. The application will allow users to register, log in, and perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts. The application will differentiate between public and private blogs, ensuring secure access and providing a user-friendly experience.

### Features and Functionality

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   - **User Registration**: Users can sign up by providing a unique username and a secure password (minimum 8 characters).
   - **User Login**: Registered users can log in to access their account.
   - **Session Management**: User sessions will be managed using `express-session` to ensure secure access control.
   - **Password Encryption**: Passwords will be securely hashed using `bcryptjs` before storing in the database.
   - **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information.

2. **Blog Management**:
   - **Public and Private Blogs**:
     - **Public Blogs**: Accessible by anyone without logging in.
     - **Private Blogs**: Only visible to the user who created them.
   - **CRUD Operations**:
     - **Create**: Authenticated users can create new blog posts.
     - **Read**: Anyone can view public blogs; authenticated users can view their private blogs.
     - **Update**: Users can update their blog posts.
     - **Delete**: Users can delete their blog posts.
   - **Multiline Text Support**: Blogs can include multiline text, enabling users to write detailed posts.

3. **Search Functionality**:
   - A search bar on the public blogs page allows users to search for blogs by keyword, providing related content dynamically.

4. **Error Handling and Notifications**:
   - **Status Codes**: Appropriate status codes (403 for forbidden, 404 for not found, 500 for internal server error) will be returned as needed.
   - **Flash Messages**: Clear notifications will be displayed to users for actions like registration, login, blog creation, etc.

5. **Security**:
   - **Input Validation**: Ensure all inputs are validated to protect against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
   - **Middleware**: Custom middleware will control access to authenticated routes and resources.

### Implementation Details

1. **Technology Stack**:
   - **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
   - **Express**: Web application framework.
   - **MongoDB**: NoSQL database.
   - **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB.
   - **Handlebars (HBS)**: Template engine for dynamic HTML rendering.
   - **bcryptjs**: Library for hashing passwords.
   - **express-session**: Middleware for session management.

2. **Project Structure**:
   - **Models**: Define User and Blog schemas using Mongoose.
   - **Routes**: Handle different HTTP requests for authentication, blog management, and search functionality.
   - **Controllers**: Implement the business logic for handling user requests and interactions with the database.
   - **Views**: Handlebars templates for rendering HTML pages.
   - **Middleware**: Custom middleware for authentication and authorization.

3. **Development Process**:
   - **Version Control**: Use GitLab for version control, with frequent commits to show the evolution of the project.
   - **Deployment**: Ensure the application can be easily set up and run with `npm install` and `npm start`.

### Conclusion

This project will not only meet the requirements of the assignment but also provide a robust and secure platform for managing blog posts. With a focus on user experience, security, and functionality, the proposed application aims to be a comprehensive solution for blog management.
